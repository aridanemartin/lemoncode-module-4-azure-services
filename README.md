This repository documents coursework and exercises from Lemoncode's Bootcamp Backend III, focusing on Azure integration. The primary exercise involves creating the DeleteHero method in the API of the Tour Of Heroes application to write messages to an Azure Storage queue for image deletion upon hero removal, ensuring database consistency. Subsequent exercises entail creating a background processing application, either as a console project or an Azure Function, to handle messages from the queue and delete associated image blobs. Developed with Lemoncode, the repository offers comprehensive guidance and code samples for Azure integration in backend development.
